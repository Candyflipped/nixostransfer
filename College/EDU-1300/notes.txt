Oftentimes, we are deceived in thinking that we know a lot about a subject simply because we can go through their contents in order, but this is not necessarily the truth. To truly understand something, it is important to draw connections between the newly learned subject and our previous experiences in order to consolidate the growth of new neural networks that provide a quick pathway to this information. Drawing a connection between various memories also provides us with a deeper understanding of the subject in a way that we can perhaps use in our day to day lives.

In the recollection of available information in the brain, human beings can be quite imperfect when in comes to the retrieval of this information. In the same way information can be lost in a computer via a random file ending up in a completely random folder that the user cannot retrieve from, the same thing happens to our memories. To make this process easier, a easy technique is to take a long string of information and then break it up into separate chunks of information. For example, it would be easier to memorize a phone number if we were to try to memorize its information in small chunks such as 314-433-5678 rather than trying to memorize the entire string of information one character at a time. This is the same method employed in textbooks where information is separated into different bite-sized chunks that are easier to digest rather than trying to read the entire book at once.
